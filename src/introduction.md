# `jms1.info`

This site is a collection of random documents, mostly technical, that I've written over the past 20+ years.

## Other Sites

These are some other public web sites that I've written over the years.

* [`jekyll.jms1.info`](https://jekyll.jms1.info/) is my first attempt at writing *thi*s site. As the name suggests, I was using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but in 2024-06 I decided to re-do the entire site using [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html).

* [`jms1.net`](https://jms1.net/) was my original "home page". It started off containing "everything", but over time I found that certain topics were taking enough space to justify moving them to their own sites.

* [`kg4zow.us`](https://kg4zow.us/) is my site about Amateur Radio. I'm not as active on the air as I used to be, mostly because I don't have the time anymore.

* [`qmail.jms1.net`](https://qmail.jms1.net/) is my old web site about [Qmail](https://cr.yp.to/qmail.html).
