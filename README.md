# `jms1.info`

This repo contains the source code for the [`jms1.info`](https://jms1.info/) web site.

The pages are written in Markdown and converted to HTML using [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/). The [mdbook-template](https://github.com/kg4zow/mdbook-template) repo has more information about how this works, as well as the customizations I use on most of my sites.

Github is NOT the primary server for this repo, it's just a backup so people can *see* it if they're curious. If you see something which needs to be corrected or improved, contact me directly.

The site's [Introduction page](https://jms1.info/#contact) has information about how to contact me.
